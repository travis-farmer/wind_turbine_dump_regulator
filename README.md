# wind_turbine_dump_regulator

trying to take power from my wind turbine, run it through my 40A MPPT charge controller, and charge my batteries. in case the wind turbine speed gets too high, the arduino will proportionatly add in extra load, and if the voltage gets way too high, it cuts out the charge controller, and cuts in a secondary dump load.

TODO:
add status LEDs, so i know what it is doing.
